## Overview

ParadoxUI allows you to manage paradox via a menu system, there are some features that are only available via the UI. All features are accessible via the GUI system. We are still actively working on the GUI so it will change between updates.

To get started all you need to do is run `!paradoxui` in chat and then close the window and you will be presented with the main menu. All options are explained within the UI.

## InventoryUI

Paradox has a inventory system where you can manage as well as edit the players inventory.

?> Note we dont use a chestGUI this is due to performance.

Once you have selected a player you will be presented with their inventory if the selected slot is a item you have the option to edit this using the Item Editor.

## Item Editor

Paradox has an item editor that you can use to edit items such as the enchantments, lores, naming, replacing the selected item as well as transferring the item or transfer a duplicate of the item.

You can also see the stats for an item this will show you enchantments lores as well as the name, and its current durability.

> In this video we will go over apply enchantments to an item, replacing the item as well as removing the item from the players inventory, When renaming and editing lores you can use colour modifiers.
