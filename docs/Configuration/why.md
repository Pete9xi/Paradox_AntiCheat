## Introduction 

Paradox has alot of advanced features, due to the restrictions put in place by mojang we are unable to write to the servers/realms storage, this means some settings within paradox have to be configured by editing a config file this is know as config.js.

To counter this issue the scripting API had a feature added called dynamic properties, paradox makes use of this throughout its codebase however up until the last release this was very restricted in size which meant advanced settings still could not be moved to this.

?>What does this mean?

Currently paradox still makes use of config.js but as soon as we can move away from this we will do. Now we understand that this can be a issue/struggle for some of our user base, we are always working on ways to improve this and do ask that you reach out to us for assistance where needed
